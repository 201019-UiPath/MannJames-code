dotnet build converts source code to assembly

1-tier application (no physical sep / 1 machine) -> ui / bl / db
2-tier app -> UI (with own BL), server (with own BL and DB) / client<->server
3-tier app -> client (w/ BL) <-> server (w/ BL) -> backend (DB)
N-tier applications -> microservices

.Net Solution

dotnet new console -o <proj name>, dotnet sln <name> add <reference to the console proj (your directory)>
dotnet new classLib -lang C# -o <name>

namespace --> types (Class, struct, interface,...) / members

Types (class, enums, structs, interface, delegates) --> value, reference
	Value types - stacks
