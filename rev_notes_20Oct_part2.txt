namespace --> types (Class, struct, interface,...) / members

Types (class, enums, structs, interface, delegates) --> value, reference
	Value types - stacks

properties are the ones you use to add logic to fields
they have the getters and setters

methods are like jsp functions, block with operations
Microsoft calls properties as smart fields to wencapsulate value of properties

collections --> arrays: generics
arrays -> 1-D, 2-D, jagged, multi-d
generics -> stack, queues, list, dictionary
