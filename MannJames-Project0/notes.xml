	<ul>
		The project seems to have solid code however has issues with retrieval of data properly.
		This is very likely an issue connecting with PostgreSQL.
		It is intended to go through three options in the main menu: inventory, customer, and employee.
		The first consists of location list, leading to location inventory based on inputted location ID.
		The second has the customer portal which leads to viewing order history and making new orders or registering a new customer.
		The last has the employee-applicable information and leads into the manager portal.
		I tried to make it comprehensive and straighforward.
		Cheers.
